# üìä ExpenseFlow

**Simple. Secure. Scalable.**
A family-oriented expense tracking system built using Clean Architecture and modern full-stack technologies.

> This project is designed with a clear separation of concerns:
>
> * A **Presentation Tier** using Angular 17 + PrimeNG
> * A **Middle Tier** using Java 21 + Spring Boot 3.x
> * Both developed with a security-first, enterprise-grade mindset

---

## üî∞ Purpose

**ExpenseFlow** exists to help individuals and families:

* Track expenses across categories
* Maintain spending discipline
* Access financial insights easily, from any device
* Avoid the ‚Äúspreadsheet with lipstick‚Äù problem

Unlike typical hobby budget apps, ExpenseFlow prioritizes:

* **Security**
* **Scalability**
* **Architectural clarity**

## üß± Architecture Overview

### üß≠ High-Level Structure

```plaintext
ExpenseFlow/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PresentationTier/   ‚Üí Angular 17 + PrimeNG (frontend)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MiddleTier/         ‚Üí Spring Boot 3.x (backend API)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/               ‚Üí Design, API, security, and roadmap documentation
```

### üß† Clean Architecture (MiddleTier)

Layered by responsibility, inspired by Uncle Bob & Phobos design principles:

```plaintext
domain/         ‚Üí Pure business logic (no Spring dependencies)  
application/    ‚Üí Use case orchestration, services, DTOs  
infrastructure/ ‚Üí JPA, security config, mappers  
interfaces/     ‚Üí REST controllers, request handling
```

| Backend (MiddleTier)        | Java 21, Spring Boot 3.x, Spring Security, JPA, PostgreSQL, Flyway, Lombok |
| Build Tools                 | Maven, npm                                                                 |

## üí° Key Features (MVP)

* [x] Add/view/delete expenses
* [x] Category and date filtering
* [x] Auth (register/login)
* [x] Security baked in from the start
* [ ] Reminders and recurring expenses (planned)
* [ ] Family-level sharing or visibility (phase II)

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### üîπ Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* Java 21
* PostgreSQL running locally (or Docker container)

---

### üîπ Run Frontend

```bash
cd PresentationTier
npm install
ng serve
```

---

### üîπ Run Backend

```bash
cd MiddleTier
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

App will be live at:
üìç `http://localhost:4200` (frontend)
üìç `http://localhost:8080` (backend API)

## üîê Security Approach

Security is built into the architecture, not bolted on:

* CSRF protection (Angular + Spring)
* CORS policy (dev-friendly, strict in prod)
* BCrypt for password hashing
* Role-based route protection (future)
* No sensitive data ever stored client-side

See [`docs/security.md`](./docs/security.md) for full breakdown.
